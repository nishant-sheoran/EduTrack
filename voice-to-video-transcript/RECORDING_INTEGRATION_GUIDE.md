# 🎙️ Real-time Recording Integration Guide

## Overview

I've implemented the real-time recording functionality you requested. The server now supports start/stop recording signals from the frontend and processes audio immediately after recording stops.

## 📋 Answers to Your Questions

### 1. What is "Latest Session"?

The "Latest Session" refers to `st.session_state.last_outputs` in the Streamlit app (`app.py`). This stores:
- **Purpose**: Keeps track of the most recently generated video and PDF files
- **Contents**: A tuple containing `(video_path, pdf_path)` 
- **Usage**: Allows users to download their results even after processing is complete
- **Location**: Lines 33-34 and 238-240 in `app.py`

In your database integration, you'll probably want to replace this with proper session storage that persists across server restarts.

## 📡 New Real-time Recording API

### 2. Server-side Recording Implementation

I've added complete server-side recording functionality:

#### **New Components:**
- **`audio_recorder.py`** - Handles real-time recording with PyAudio/FFmpeg fallback
- **Updated `api.py`** - New endpoints for recording control
- **`test_recording.html`** - Test interface for the new functionality

#### **New API Endpoints:**

```http
POST /recording/start
POST /recording/stop  
GET /recording/status
GET /session/{session_id}
GET /sessions
DELETE /session/{session_id}
```

### Workflow:

1. **Frontend sends "start" signal** → `POST /recording/start`
2. **Server starts recording** → Returns session_id
3. **Frontend sends "stop" signal** → `POST /recording/stop`
4. **Server stops recording** → Automatically processes audio through full pipeline
5. **Results available** → Via session endpoints or download links

## 🚀 Integration Steps for Your Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Add to your requirements.txt or install directly:
pip install pyaudio  # For Python ≤3.12
# For Python 3.13+, ensure FFmpeg is installed
```

### Step 2: Start the Enhanced API Server
```bash
cd EduTrack-voice-features
uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**✅ Your server is now running! You should see:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
WARNING:  Could not import Python 3.13+ compatible modules: No module named 'pyaudioop'
INFO:audio_recorder:AudioRecorder initialized with method: subprocess
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**Note:** The `pyaudioop` warning is normal for Python 3.13+ - it will use FFmpeg instead.

### ✅ Quick Test (Server is Running!)

**Since your server is already running, open a NEW terminal and test:**

```bash
# Open a new PowerShell terminal and run:

# Test 1: Check if server responds
curl http://localhost:8000/recording/status

# Test 2: Run the automated test script
python test_recording_endpoints.py

# Test 3: Or open the web interface
# Open test_recording.html in your browser and click "Start Recording"
```

### Step 3: Frontend Integration
Replace file upload with these API calls:

```javascript
// Start recording
const startResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/recording/start', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({})
});
const { session_id } = await startResponse.json();

// Stop recording and process
const stopResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/recording/stop', {
    method: 'POST', 
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        process_immediately: true,
        topic_hint: "Your Topic Here"  // optional
    })
});

// Monitor processing status
const sessionResponse = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/session/${session_id}`);
const session = await sessionResponse.json();
// session.status can be: "recording", "processing", "completed", "error"
```

### Step 4: Database Integration Points

You'll want to modify these parts for your database:

#### **In `api.py`:**
```python
# Replace this in-memory storage:
active_sessions: Dict[str, SessionInfo] = {}

# With your database calls:
# - Store session info in your DB
# - Query session status from DB  
# - Update session progress in DB
```

#### **Session Management:**
- **Create session** → Store in your database with user info
- **Update status** → Update database records during processing
- **Retrieve results** → Query from database instead of memory
- **Clean up** → Database cleanup instead of file deletion

## 🧪 Testing

### 🎙️ **Testing Start/Stop Recording Functionality:**

#### **Method 1: Use the Web Test Interface (Easiest)**
```bash
# 1. Start the API server
uvicorn api:app --reload

# 2. Open the test page in your browser
# Open: test_recording.html
# Click "Start Recording" → Should show "Recording in progress..."
# Speak into your microphone for a few seconds
# Click "Stop Recording" → Should process automatically
```

#### **Method 2: Command Line Testing**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
uvicorn api:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Test the recording endpoints

# Check if server is ready
curl http://localhost:8000/recording/status

# Start recording
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' http://localhost:8000/recording/start
# Should return: {"status": "success", "session_id": "some-uuid", ...}

# Check recording status (should show is_recording: true)
curl http://localhost:8000/recording/status

# Wait 5-10 seconds (speak into microphone)

# Stop recording and process
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"process_immediately": true, "topic_hint": "test"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/recording/stop
# Should return: {"status": "success", "message": "Recording stopped, processing started", ...}

# Check session status
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions
```

#### **Method 3: Check Recording Hardware**
```bash
# Test if your microphone is working:
# Windows: Check Sound Settings → Input devices
# Test recording with built-in Voice Recorder app first

# Check if Python can access microphone:
python -c "
import pyaudio
pa = pyaudio.PyAudio()
print('Audio devices:')
for i in range(pa.get_device_count()):
    info = pa.get_device_info_by_index(i)
    if info['maxInputChannels'] > 0:
        print(f'  {i}: {info[\"name\"]} (inputs: {info[\"maxInputChannels\"]})')
pa.terminate()
"
```

#### **Method 4: Use the Automated Test Script**
```bash
# I've created a test script that automatically tests start/stop recording:
python test_recording_endpoints.py

# This script will:
# 1. Check server connection
# 2. Start recording
# 3. Wait for you to speak
# 4. Stop recording
# 5. Show results
# 6. Verify everything worked
```

#### **Method 5: Debug Recording Issues**
```bash
# If recording doesn't work, check:

# 1. Check if FFmpeg is available (for Python 3.13+)
ffmpeg -version

# 2. Check Python version compatibility
python --version

# 3. Check if pyaudio is installed (for Python ≤3.12)
python -c "import pyaudio; print('PyAudio available')"

# 4. Check server logs for errors
# Look at the terminal running uvicorn for error messages
```

Use the new test interface:
1. Open `test_recording.html` in your browser
2. Click "Start Recording" 
3. Speak into your microphone
4. Click "Stop Recording"
5. Monitor processing progress
6. Download results when complete

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Recording Quality:
```python
# In audio_recorder.py, modify these:
self.sample_rate = 44100  # CD quality
self.channels = 1         # Mono recording
```

### Processing Options:
```python
# In API calls:
{
    "process_immediately": true,  # Start processing right after recording
    "topic_hint": "Mathematics"   # Help AI understand the content
}
```

## 🔄 Integration with Your Database

Here's how to connect this with your database system:

### Replace Session Storage:
```python
# Instead of:
active_sessions: Dict[str, SessionInfo] = {}

# Use your database:
class DatabaseSessionManager:
    def create_session(self, user_id, session_data):
        # Insert into your sessions table
        pass
    
    def update_session(self, session_id, updates):
        # Update session status/results
        pass
    
    def get_session(self, session_id):
        # Query session from database
        pass
```

### Add User Authentication:
```python
@app.post("/recording/start")
async def start_recording(request: RecordingStartRequest, user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Associate recording with user
    # Store in database with user context
```

### File Management:
- Store file paths in database
- Implement file cleanup policies
- Add download tracking/analytics

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Microphone Permissions**: Browser will ask for microphone access
2. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Uses FFmpeg fallback when PyAudio isn't available
3. **File Cleanup**: Original recordings are deleted after processing
4. **Session Persistence**: Currently in-memory - you'll want database storage
5. **Error Handling**: Full error handling for recording failures

## 🎯 Ready for Your Integration!

The system now:
- ✅ Starts recording on "start" signal
- ✅ Stops recording on "stop" signal
